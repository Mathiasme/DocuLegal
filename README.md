This is a basic project that I created to explore ChatGPT. The purpose is to upload two files:

- A Word document that contains a template or an example of what you need to generate
- An Excel document that contains multiple rows, for each of which you want to generate a document using the data specified on the row

This code provides a user interface to do so and outputs a variable template that you can use for each of your rows. You can also edit the prompt in order to modify the result. There is a default prompt provided, but I believe it may no longer be correct due to changes made by OpenAI to ChatGPT-3.5.

You'll need a Unioffice API key and a ChatGPT-3.5 api key.
Note that the code will probably be hard to use out of the box but can be understood quite easily.
I provided two working files so you can try it out. 

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or feedback.
